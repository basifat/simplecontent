## Who are we?
We aim to help aspiring and new developers become proficient with Python and related backend technologies.

## Why are we different?
We are a technical blog that teaches technical excellence as much as we share resources and tools required to become a successful Python developerâ€”everything from productivity tools, developer interviews, success stories, coding journeys, lessons learned, in-depth tutorials, and more from the Python community.

## How does our mission make people's lives better? 
1. Readers learn in depth about Python topics and related backend technologies. 
2. Readers become more confident in using the Python programming language by learning new ways, along with several examples.
3. Readers read and get motivation or a morale boost from stories of people in similar situations who have improved their coding knowledge or increased their pay. 
4. Readers learn from featured interviews with people who have already walked the path of their current journey.
5. Readers can access code repositories, snippets, resources, tools, and tricks to transition their knowledge.
6. Readers learn new concepts, tips, and tricks weekly from the comfort of their email inboxes through our newsletter.
